# SlenderGirls

Banaipe & Pedro4001 are the guys behind this project.

This will be a Slender style horror game made using the free version of Unity.

We're using this repository to share ideias and to receive some help from gurus all over the world.

If you want to help, just do it! You are free to do so! We love open source like you guys :)

# About the Game

It'll be based in the original version of SlenderMan. The key difference is that we'll be using the "girls" from the real story.

To finish the game you have to find some pieces of paper that will tell you where to find the key used to open the exit door.

Be careful not to encounter the monster while you're walking trough the map!
