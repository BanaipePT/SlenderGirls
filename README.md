# SlenderGirls

## Introduction

**BanaipePT** & **Kiritozama** are the guys behind this project.

We are going to create a **Slender style** horror game using the free version of Unity.

This repository was created so we can share ideias and receive some help from gurus all over the world.

If you want to help, just do it! You are free to do so! We love open source like you guys do :)

## About the Game

This game is going to be based in the original version of **SlenderMan**. The key difference is that we'll be using the *"girls"* from the real story.

To complete the level you have to find some **pieces of paper** that will tell you where to find **the key** used to open the exit door.

Be careful not to encounter **the monster** while you're walking through the map!

## Key Features

* High quality horror map;
* High quality identities;
* High quality animations;
* Human-like walking;
* Monster uses advanced algorithms to follow you;
* Health and Stamina;

* Enigma made with pieces of paper placed around the map.

## Roadmap

* Create the initial map and scene;
* Deploy characters and entities;
* Write scripts for animation;
* Import music and sfx;
* Deploy on Steam platform.
